# Flexirest

> Access your REST APIs in a flexible way.
>
> Write your API classes in an ActiveRecord-style; like ActiveResource but Flexirest works where the resource naming doesn't follow Rails conventions, it has built-in caching and is much more flexible.

## Background

If you are a previous user of [ActiveRestClient](https://github.com/whichdigital/active-rest-client), there's some more information on [why I created this fork and how to upgrade](docs/migrating-from-activerestclient.md) - but long story short, I wrote most of the code as a previous gem for a client, they agreed to open-source it, then it was abandoned and I relaunched it and now support it myself (and the owners of ActiveRestClient have acknowledged their gem is deprecated in favour of Flexirest).

## Quickstart

Assuming you're using [Bundler](http://bundler.io), to use Flexirest add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'flexirest'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

To use it, let's create a new model class:

```ruby
# app/models/person.rb
class Person < Flexirest::Base
  base_url "https://www.example.com/api/v1"

  get :all, "/people"
  get :find, "/people/:id"
  put :save, "/people/:id"
  post :create, "/people"
  delete :remove, "/people/:id"
end
```

You can then use your new class like this:

```ruby
# Create a new person
@person = Person.create(
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Smith"
)

# Find a person (not needed after creating)
id = @person.id
@person = Person.find(id)

# Update a person
@person.last_name = "Jones"
@person.save

# Get all people
@people = Person.all
@people.each do |person|
  puts "Hi " + person.first_name
end
```

### Bug Reports & Feature Requests

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/flexirest/flexirest/issues) to report any bugs or file feature requests.

If you want to generate a reproducible bug report, here are some steps to follow in your bug report:

1. Clone the Flexirest repo (`git clone https://github.com/flexirest/flexirest.git`)
2. Change to the flexirest folder (`cd flexirest`)
3. Install any dependencies (`bundle install`)
4. Run an interactive console (`rake c`)
5. Paste the following:

```ruby
class MyObject < Flexirest::Base
  base_url "https://requestb.in"
  post :create, "/{CREATE_A_PASTEBIN_ID}"
end

my_object = MyObject.new(params: "something")
my_object.create
# => something is output to the terminal
```

### Working on the codebase

The general steps are the same as for almost all codebases on GitHub:

1. Fork it and clone your fork
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request on GitHub.com

We have a guide written about [Flexirest Internals](docs/internals.md) if you want to know how it all hangs together. We also have lots of RSpec specifications, tested with Travis CI.
