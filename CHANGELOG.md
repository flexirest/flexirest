## 1.9.17

Feature:

- Methods can be specified as a symbol for generating fake data (thanks to Niall Duggan for the feature request).

## 1.9.16

## 1.8.8

Fix:

- Use custom type and name for JSON-API fields (thanks to François Ferrandis for the PR).

Fix:

- Correct HTTP status code for too many requests (thanks to Tomohiko Mimura, @mito5525 for spotting this).

## 1.8.5

Fix:

- Array and Hash parameters should not have their fieldname CGI escaped, Rails doesn't like it and the RFC doesn't require it

## 1.8.4

Fix:

- Missed dependency that should have been specified.

- Added a specific `Flexirest::HTTPTooManyRequestsClientException` for 429 errors, to enable easier trapping

## 1.8.0

Features:

- For the weird situations where the remote API expects some weird formatted input, you can now specify a `request_body_type` of plain and pass in to the call `body` (and optionally `content_type`) to pass it untouched to the API. The [docs](docs/body-types.md) have been updated.

## 1.7.9

Features:

- The `ignore_root` method now can ignore a tree of labels, rather than just one top level (thanks to gkosmr for the issue and pull request)

Fix:

- plain requests to URLs that are just the domain e.g. "https://www.example.com" should also work (i.e. without any trailing path, even a '/')

## 1.7.7

Change:

- Set the default charset to UTF-8 for form encoded request bodies, the same as it already was for JSON encoded request bodies.

## 1.7.6

Feature:

- Changed `Flexirest::HTTPException#message` and `#to_s` for a better description of the error than just the class name.

## 1.7.5

Feature:

- Implemented `Flexirest::ResultIterator#join` for closer to native handling of ActiveModel::Errors in Rails applications.

## 1.7.4

Feature:

- Returning `:retry` or now raising `Flexirest::CallbackRetryRequestException` from a callback will retry the current request.

## 1.7.3

Bugfix:

- Form encoded requests should also honour `wrap_root` (thanks to noctivityinc for the issue report)

Feature:

- Returning `false` from a callback will halt the callback chain and cancel the request (thanks to noctivityinc for the feature request)

## 1.7.2

Bugfix:

- JSON responses containing `null` crashed Flexirest, now they return a valid but empty object (thanks to Thomas Steinhausen for the PR)

## 1.6.9

Feature:

- Empty response bodies with an unparseable content-type are forced to be JSON with an empty JSON body

## 1.6.8

Feature:

- A refactoring to allow users to chose to use ActiveModel validation instead of the custom ActiveModel-like validation built in to Flexirest. In a future release this will become the default. (thanks to KARASZI István for the pull request)

## 1.6.7

Bugfix:

- Returning the string value for a field that looks like a Date/DateTime instead of raising an error when the value can't be parsed (thanks to Give Corps for the pull request)

## 1.6.6

Feature:

- Username and Password can now take a block/proc for dynamically retrieving the username and password, and will pass in the object if called in a current object context (thanks to Sam Starling for suggesting this lack of functionality)

## 1.6.5

Bugfix:

- Plain requests were having the URL output to the log twice (thanks to Dan W for reporting this)

## 1.6.4

- Allowing instantiating a class if mapped request method is called for "JSON-API" functionality (thanks to Mike Voets for this PR).

## 1.6.1

Feature:

- Added `where` filtering to result iterators (thanks to Jeljer te Wies for the feature).

## 1.6.0

Feature:

- APIs that expect request bodies to have a wrapping element can now have this specified at mapping time.

## 1.5.9

Bugfix:

- Changing `_request` to accept options, including `:headers`, rather than headers directly

## 1.5.3

Feature:

- Allow passing custom headers as an option to raw requests.

## 1.5.2

Bugfix:

- Some APIs return an empty response body even on 200s, so any valid status with an empty body should be handled nicely

Bugfix:

- PUT/POST/PATCH methods called on an instantiated object should merge the objects attributes with specified params.

## 1.5.0

Bugfix:

- GET requests with the same URL as PUT requests shouldn't use the etag cached version.

Feature:

- You can define how to handle the body of `delete` requests now with the mapping option `send_delete_body`.

## 1.4.5

Bugfix:

## 1.4.4

Feature:

- Handling 202s without any content the same as a 204.

## 1.4.3

Feature:

- Added more client exceptions to allow fine grained exception trapping

## 1.4.2

- Parameters sent within the URL (e.g. /foo/:bar) should be URI escaped or Flexirest raises an error about unparseable URLs

## 1.3.25

Feature:

- Improvements in performance due to date parsing (thanks to guanglunw for the PR)

- Should not parse multiline strings as `DateTime` when using the automatica parsing (thanks to execjosh for the PR)

## 1.3.22

Bugfix:

- Broke a test in v1.3.21 (according to Travis) which was passing locally, updated all my gems and then it broke locally, so reverted the test.

- Added Headers in to Flexirest::ResponseParseException to aid debugging of why it doesn't work against custom APIs.

## 1.3.18

Feature:

- Simplistic load balancing of API servers by supplying an array of URLs to `base_url`. It then pulls a random one out for each request.

## 1.3.17

Bugfix:

- Authentication credentials weren't being passed through proxied classes (thanks to Lukasz Modlinski for the contribution).

## 1.3.16

Feature:

Feature:

- Allows setting of the ApiAuth `:digest` or `:override_http_method` if v2.0 or above of ApiAuth is installed (thanks to Alan Ruth for the request).

## 1.3.14

Feature:

- Plain Requests (both using the `plain: true` option to mapped methods and using `_plain_request`) return a `Flexirest::PlainResponse` which is string-like for all intents and purposes (it's comparable with strings using the body of the response) and also has `_status` and `_headers` methods (thanks to Rui Ribeiro for the request/inspiration).

## 1.3.13

Feature:

- The undocumented `plain: true` option to mapped methods was tested and documented.

## 1.3.12

Bugfix:

- The Travis build was breaking because Guard pulls in Listen, which only runs on Ruby 2.2 and above. So I removed Guard so the gem can be tested to work against older Ruby versions still.

## 1.3.11

Feature:

- Made the `Flexirest::*Exception#message` much nicer to help debugging applications, e.g. `Sending PUT to '/enable' returned a 500 with the body of - {"error":"John doesn't exist", "code":1234}`.

Bugfix:

- Removed some warnings about using uninitialized variables (thanks to Joel Low for the heads-up).

## 1.3.5

Bugfix:

- Deeply nested has_many relationships weren't working (thanks to Lewis Buckley for the bug report, spec and fix).

## 1.3.4

Features:

- Allows assigning `STDOUT` to `Flexirest::Logger.logfile` which can be useful when debugging Flexirest or applications at the console (either `rails console` from a Rails app or `rake console` from within Flexirest's codebase) along with setting `verbose!` on the class.

## 1.3.3

Features:

- New Ruby on Rails integration guide (thanks to Matthias Neumayr)
- New `ignore_root` method to ignore JSON or XML root nodes, deprecated `ignore_xml_root` (thanks to dsarhadian for the request)

## 1.3.2

Features:

- Allow setting the body for a delete request - whether this is within HTTP spec is dubious, but a few APIs require it (thanks to Jeffrey Gu)

## 1.3.1

Features:

- You can now use `has_many`/`has_one` on the class live, more like ActiveRecord

## 1.3.0

Features:

## 1.2.16

Feature:

- Replaces URL `:keyed` parameters for direct requests.

## 1.2.15

Feature:

- Fixing issue when moving from ActiveRestClient to Flexirest - cached responses have the old class in them, so come through as a String

## 1.2.14

Bugfixes:

- Patch was partially implemented in 2014, but never completed. It should be working now (thanks to Joel Low)

## 1.2.13

Bugfixes:

- Putting README.md back the way it was regarding ApiAuth (thanks to Kevin Glowacz)

## 1.2.12

Bugfixes:

- Correcting README.md to make ApiAuth usage clearer (thanks to Jeffrey Gu)

## 1.2.11

Bugfixes:

- Fixes the usage of :timeout on a per-request basis

## 1.2.10

Bugfixes:

- Fixing messages used during validation of maximum numericality (thanks Tom Hoen)

## 1.2.8

Bugfixes:

- There was a strange problem with Flexirest defining methods on `Class` rather than on the specific class (which only presents itself when another class in the application is making use of `method_missing`).

## 1.2.7

Features:

- Adds a per request `timeout` option, for individually slow calls
